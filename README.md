# Expression-Evaluator
This program allows the user to input an expression using numbers and variables and will compute the expression

Please fell free to learn from this code but DO NOT copy the code completely. Doing so may be considered plagerism.

Also, I only coded the "Expression" file, all the other code is written by Rutgers staff
